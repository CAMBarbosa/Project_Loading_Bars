# Project Loading Bars
A small SPA with pages where you can browse through different loading bars by choosing the symbol used in the bar

## General Information about frameworks/libraries used
I'm using React as building block but intend to have similar projects built with Angular and Vue.

## Commit Rules
I'll follow the following commit ID rules:

All file commited will have a description with type of file, Id of subject and small information about what was made or changed.

Example:

**[Documentation - CENTRAL README FILE] - Initial information and commit**

Types of commit files will be: Documentation, Tests, Implementation;
